# Geometric Neuroscience

The purpose of this project is to study the symmetry and geometry in neural representations via computational methods like geometric deep learning (Bronstein, 2021), topology, algebra and graphs. 

# State-of-art Review and NeurReps Workshop 2024

I'm going to review all key highlights, talks and relevant posters during the NeuReps Workshop at NeurIPS 2024.
